\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In this chapter we presented \name (\shortname), a practical schema to deploy Time-Locked secrets on the blockchain by leveraging an economic model in which every rational actor (or coalition of them) is economically incentivized to comply with the protocol.
	\item As a future work, we are already considering the use of homomorphic encryption for the share generation process. This will not require any changes to the protocol itself but only to the \texttt{generate\_shares} primitive, effectively yielding the $\shortname_{HE}$ implementation. This realization would further reduce the time and resources required to setup the \shortname protocol.
	\item Another future work is to analyze the inequalities in Section~\ref{sect:constraints} from an economic standpoint and to better characterize the relation among the parameters.
