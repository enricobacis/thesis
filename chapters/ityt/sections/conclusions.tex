\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:conclusions}

In this chapter we presented \name (\shortname), a practical schema to deploy Time-Locked secrets on the blockchain by leveraging an economic model in which every rational actor (or coalition of them) is economically incentivized to comply with the protocol.
As opposed to other time-lock mechanisms, \shortname requires neither a trusted party, nor a decrypting party willing to run the decryption algorithm until the disclosure time, nor guesses on the computational power that will be available in the future.
Our implementation and experimental evaluation showed that the deployment costs and the required computational resources are compatible with many applications.

As future work, we are considering the use of homomorphic encryption for the share generation process. This will not require any changes to the protocol itself but only to the share generation primitive. This realization would further reduce the time and resources required to setup the \shortname protocol. Another interesting future work would be to further analyze the inequalities in Section~\ref{sect:constraints} from and economic standpoint to better characterize the relation among the parameters.
