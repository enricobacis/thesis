\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:conclusions}

In this chapter, we presented \name (\shortname), a practical schema to deploy Time-Locked secrets on the blockchain by leveraging an economic model in which every rational actor (or coalition of them) is economically incentivized to correctly participate.
As opposed to other Time-Lock mechanisms, \shortname requires neither trust assumptions, nor a receiving party willing to run the decryption algorithm until the disclosure time, nor guesses about future computing power.
Our implementation and experimental evaluation showed that our approach is practical, as the cost and the required computing power associated are limited.

As future work, we are considering the use of homomorphic encryption for the share generation process. This will not require any changes to the protocol itself, but only to the share generation algorithm. By doing so, we expect that the time and resources needed to setup the protocol will be further reduced.
We are also interested in conducting a more thorough analysis of the inequalities in Section~\ref{sect:constraints} from an economic standpoint, to better characterize the correlations among the parameters.
