\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As a future work, we are already considering the use of homomorphic encryption for the share generation process. This will not require any changes to the protocol itself but only to the \texttt{generate\_shares} primitive, effectively yielding the $\shortname_{HE}$ implementation. This realization would further reduce the time and resources required to setup the \shortname protocol.
