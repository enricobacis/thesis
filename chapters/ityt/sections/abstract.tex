A Time-Lock enables the release of a secret at a specific future point in time.
Most current research proposals bind the recovery of the secret to the solution of cryptographic puzzles.
These solutions, however, are  impractical, as solving the puzzle requires a significant computational effort and provides no timing guarantees.

To overcome these problems, we propose {\em \name (\shortname)}, a novel way of implementing time-locked secrets based on smart contracts.
\shortname relies on blockchain to measure the elapse of time, and it combines threshold cryptography with economic incentives and penalties, to effectively replace cryptographic puzzles.

% to remove the need of any trusted party.
%We rely on blockchains as a distributed source of time, and we combine 
%This way, clients can be involved in multiple TL instances without wasting computational resources.

We implement a prototype of \shortname on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 
Our prototype leverages secure Multi-Party Computation to avoid any single point of trust.
We also analyze resiliency to attacks with the help of economic game theory, in the context of rational adversaries.
The experiments demonstrate the low cost and resource consumption associated with our approach.
