Humans have always been trying to monitor the passing of time and to hand down
information for posterity.  The 1989 Oxford English
Dictionary~\cite{dictionary1989oxford} defines a {\em time capsule} as:
``{\em a
	container used to store for posterity a selection of objects thought to be
	representative of life at a particular time}''.

After storing documents and
memories inside the time capsule, they are generally buried underground,
sometimes even sent out to space~\cite{jarvis2015time}.
Another interesting application of time capsules is to unconditionally reveal secrets at a future date.

Starting from the 90's, researchers have been designing techniques to create a
digital counterpart of the physical time capsule~\cite{may1993timed} and they
named these techniques {\em Time-Locks}.
