\section{Conclusions}\label{ms:sec:conclu}
We presented an approach for efficiently enforcing access revocation on encrypted resources stored at external providers. Our solution enables data owners to effectively revoke access by simply overwriting a small portion of the (potentially large) resource and is resilient against attacks by users locally maintaining copies of previously-used keys. Our implementation and experimental evaluation confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal, which enjoys orders of magnitude of improvement in throughput with respect to resource re-writing, and confirms its compatibility with current cloud storage solutions, making it also immediately applicable to many application domains.
